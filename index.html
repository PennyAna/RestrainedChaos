                   <p id="about0">
                   I have a breadth of experiences not found in your average tech applicant. My education began with ¾ of a Classical Latin Teaching degree at BYU from 2001 to 2004. I took time from my education and the professional world to raise and teach my children over the past sixteen years. In homeschooling, I developed skills in organization, planning, and teaching that have been integral to my current degree. I also learned how to deal with difficult personalities, be flexible, and work with state and local requirements, valuable skills to bring to any position.

                   <p id="about1">
                    I am passionate about doing work that helps and contributes. My personal motto, “In Minimus: Refer” translates to: “In the least: Matter.” I earnestly seek out opportunities to work in local organizations, religious and secular, to help lift others and develop their confidence and abilities.
                   </p>
                   <p id="about2">
                    As a teacher, I’ve been passionate about continuing my own education. Constantly working to learn and apply new information and concepts led me to return to my bachelor’s degree in a completely new field: software engineering. After all, most languages are easy after Latin. My breadth in learning bolsters me when faced with an unfamiliar situation or subject. As necessary, I quickly pinpoint what knowledge I need and thoroughly acquire it.
